He has tried his best to make friends but he has failed. Generic_Name, very discouraged, decided to ask his mom for some pointers on how to make friends. When he got home from school he went right into the kitchen to ask his mom for some help. His mom simply said, &quot;Be yourself, they will come around, trust me.&quot; Generic_Name was frustrated because he was being his self but they just looked at him like he was an alien. He knew it was time to turn to his older sister, Generic_Name. Later that evening when Generic_Name came home from basketball practice he knew it time to ask her what to do. After she had gotten settled he went into her room knowing she was his only hope. Generic_Name told him that, &quot;You are the new kid, fresh meat. Give them a break and do not try as hard to want their attention. The best way to gain someones attention is to not want it.&quot; After doing exactly what his sister said to do, two of the boys from his gym class came and sat beside him at lunch. Generic_Name could have just went with his moms advice, but after talking to his sister he has now made two new friends.\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n</br></br>Also, \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #bbceae; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    asking the advice of others helps one to grow. When someone asks for help they tend to remember how to deal with those specific situations later on in life.\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Claim</span>\n</mark>\n \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #c8f1bf; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    For instance, Generic_Name is struggling in her math class. Every time the class has a test she always finishes first, that is why she does not understand why her grades are not good in Ms. Generic_Name's math class. She told Generic_Name, &quot;I do not get it, I always finish my work first! I do not understand why I continue to get bad grades in here.&quot; Ms. Generic_Name told her that, &quot;Not everything is a race Generic_Name. The test are not timed so there is no need to rush.&quot; Generic_Name was very confused, she did not understand she thought if she finished fast that meant because she was so smart and did not need the extra time. When Generic_Name came to class the next day she asked her friends how they get such good grades on the test and they all said in a cautious tone, &quot;Read the questions carefully! Ms. Generic_Name is always trying to trick us.&quot; When Ms. Generic_Name entered the classroom she announced to the class that they had a pop quiz. Generic_Name still thinking of what her teacher and friends told her took her time on the pop quiz and earned an ninety five percent. Generic_Name was so proud. From now on Generic_Name knew that in order to make good grades she would have to just slow down a bit and take her time. Like Ms. Generic_Name said, &quot;Slow and steady wins the race, or in this case receives a good grade.&quot;\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n</br></br>In addition, \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #bbceae; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    taking the advice from others can help one to see the situation from a different point of view. Sometimes a person looking from the outside in on the situation may just help find a solution to it. \n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Claim</span>\n</mark>\n\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #c8f1bf; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Specifically, Generic_Name and Generic_Name have been best friends for forever and they do everything together. Every summer Generic_Name and Generic_Name go to basketball camp together but not this year. Generic_Name just got excepted into the Generic_City Summer Science Camp she has been trying to get into since the first grade. Generic_Name was so excited she had to call up her best friend Generic_Name and tell her the great news except Generic_Name did not think it was so great. When summer came around for the first time they had to go their separate ways to different camps. Generic_Name was really mad but she still missed her best friend the whole summer. Generic_Name, on the other hand was loving science camp she wrote to Generic_Name everyday trying to see how she was doing and telling how the great time she was having. Generic_Name decided that she was not going to write Generic_Name back in return of her just up and leaving her for science camp. When the girls returned back to school Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name which left her sad and confused. Generic_Name had no idea why she was acting that way she decided to ask their other friends if any of them knew why Generic_Name was acting that way but no one knew. When Generic_Name got home for her first day back to school she was greeted by her mom who was now confused as to why she looked so upset.

As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, &quot;almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted&quot; (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track. All in all, a world without video learning for all students is a one that strengthen's one's work ethic through practice in the work place rather than at home.\n\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n</br>\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #bbceae; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Secondly, distance learning encourages antisocial behavior among students, especially in the elementary and middle school level where their brains are developing social skills. \n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Claim</span>\n</mark>\n\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #c8f1bf; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    According to the New York Times, &quot;children at the earliest age of 6 years old begin developing social patterns that they will continue to emulate throughout their entire lives&quot; (Generic_Name). This proves how these years in a classroom are a crucial time for developing young minds to nurture and grow into mature adults. The reason why video based learning will tamper with this stage in student's minds is because if they only work at home, then unless they go to after school activities, they will not experience how to physically develop long lasting relationships with other people in a work setting. When a teacher assigns a group project, students not only learn about a the topic of their assignment but how to work with and interact with other humans beings of a similar intellect.\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #d3b88a; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    While human interaction can be achieved through video calls,\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Counterclaim</span>\n</mark>\n \n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ef8c9d; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    the experience is way different then if they were to be with each other physically learning how to productively cooperate with people sitting right next to them. \n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Rebuttal</span>\n</mark>\n\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #c8f1bf; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    This is an important skill to develop because it reflects how people in the real world work in corporate settings to solve a problem together. If one cannot work with other people with differing perspectives in a constructive manner then they will struggle their entire lives. Thus, distance learning also negatively impacts students by denying them the chance to develop social skills that will be vital to them when they become independent adults.\n\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n</br>\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #bbceae; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    Lastly, video based learning should not be mandatory for all students because it is more difficult for teachers to give individual assistance to students who are struggling in the class.\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Claim</span>\n</mark>\n\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #c8f1bf; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n     Most often then not, there has been a time where everyone has not understood a concept in a class, or has had a question about an assignment. Video based learning does not help these people since it is more of a hassle for teachers to continue on with a lesson and answer a hundred different questions simultaneously.\n\nRecently, a poll taken in 2019 with the schools who attempted to use distance learning reported that, &quot;almost 95% of students had their grades drop between half and a full letter grade in the past semester because it was more difficult for them to ask questions and succeed&quot; (Generic_Name). This statistic shows from a student's perspective how this educational system is not even increasing the rate of obtaining high grades, which is what this option was meant to do. The interactions between a teacher and a student in a physical setting is what makes the standard class a successful system since it ensures that teachers have an equal opportunity to make the lesson as clear as possible. Video based learning completely takes that function of a classroom away, which hurts students by making it harder to do well in school. Thus, distance learning should not be implemented in schools all around the world since it will only work against students goals.\n\n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Evidence</span>\n</mark>\n</br>\n<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ed9a8b; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n    In conclusion, distance learning is a system with good intentions, but has its flaws that makes it far inferior to the standard classroom. This is because it limits the ability to have a strong work ethic, to develop social skills, and to have the option to ask as many questions as students need. All in all, this educational system will result in an ill equipped generation that is not ready for adulthood and the workplace, and should not be used in schools in the coming future. \n    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">Concluding Statement</span>\n</mark>\n</div></span>"
